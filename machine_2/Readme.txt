This folder includes the PSCAD cosimulation interface and the python code to run the PSCAD cosimulation. There are three DERs with generic grid-following controllers, and among them, two DERs have better fault-ride-through designs. PSCAD v5.1 with GF4.6 compiler is preferred to run the PSCAD model.
